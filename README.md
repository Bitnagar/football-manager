## The UI is responsive

The UI is responsive. At-least `1200px` width is necessary for viewing the project. The project is best viewed on `1500px` width but is adaptable to a minimum of `1200px` width.

## Project Overview

The project is built using **Next.js + Typescript**. State management has been achieved with **Redux Toolkit**. All the UI designs are near to pixel perfect and matches with the Figma designs provided for the challenge.

The project is responsive and require a minimum width of `1200px` to view without breaking the layout.

The **Formation Page** is a fully **custom built** page. There is a separate route for accessing it. No custom libraries or components were used to make it.

The project is deployed on **Vercel**.

The reason for using Next.js was to take advantage of their optimised platform and to ease the routing process. Typescript allowed to have type safety. Redux toolkit makes it easy to manage state by creating a global store for storing state and accessing it anywhere in the app.

## State Structure

The state has been structured in the following fashion:

```javascript

// state for metadata - total
metadata: {
    goalkeepers: 0,
    defenders: 0,
    midfielders: 0,
    forwards: 0,
    starters: 0,
    total: 0
},
// state required for roster table and formation
rosterData: {
    team: 'My Team', // team name. Defaults to "My Team"
    players: [], // contains players data parsed from csv file
    fields: [], // contains column names/fields present in csv file.
    starters: [] // contains the data of the starter players.
}
```
